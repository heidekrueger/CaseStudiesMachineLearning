## MTheme

We are using Matthias Vogelgesang's MTheme for LaTeX beamer. (See below for documentation and license.)

Important: To use the theme properly you need to have the Mozilla Fira font family installed and use xelatex to compile the document! (not pdflatex)


## Beamer mtheme

The *mtheme* is a Beamer theme with minimal visual noise. The core design principles
of the theme were described in a [blog post](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).
Not convinced? Have a look at the [demo slides](demo.pdf).
